# Urban Mart Food Inventory Analysis

# About
 UrbanMart, a rapidly growing grocery retailer, is seeking to optimize its profitability by implementing 
an effective pricing strategy for its diverse product range. Currently, the company faces challenges in 
managing the price points of its items to ensure they are both competitive and profitable, considering 
factors such as the cost of procurement, expected revenue, markup profit, and the cost of goods sold 
(COGS).
Moreover, with the perishable nature of many of its products, UrbanMart must also navigate the 
complexity of product expiry dates, which can significantly impact both inventory management and 
sales.
By leveraging the available dataset, which includes details on item category, purchase price, purchase 
date, quantity, expiry date, item status, and unit price of items, UrbanMart aims to derive actionable 
insights that can guide its pricing and inventory management strategies.
